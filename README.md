dump of my solutions + notes for algorithmic programming problems

there's no need to make a repo for this

but i find that making one so I can see greens filling on my github is a good way to track habits - and i need to build that habit of studying algorithms now so I can better ace algorithmic coding job interviews this year

- `\codeforces`: my notes and solutions to problems at codeforces
- `\leetcode-etc`: mostly solutions for leetcode.com and geeksforgeeks
